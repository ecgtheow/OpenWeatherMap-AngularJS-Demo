## OpenWeatherMap AngularJS Demo

A simple demo of an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) (v1.5) Single
Page Application to view a 5-day weather forecast using the
[OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api).  Highlights
include:

* application style and layout managed by
  [AngularUI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)

* development tasks run by [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) (v4), with
  automatic browser reloading on changes handled by
  [browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io)

* script bundling with [browserify](http://browserify.org)

* extensive unit testing with
[karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) and
[jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io)

* test code coverage reporting with
[istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)

* end-to-end testing with
[protractor](http://www.protractortest.org) and
[selenium-standalone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-standalone)

* documentation generated by
[gulp-ngdocs](https://github.com/nikhilmodak/gulp-ngdocs)

* code standards maintained with the help of
[jshint](http://www.jshint.com), [jscs](http://jscs.info) and
[sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint).


## Install

Clone this repository, and run

```
$ npm install
```

## Run

From the top-level directory, run

```
$ gulp serve
```

and point a web browser at http://127.0.0.1:4300.  For source code documentation, use http://127.0.0.1:4300/docs.

All source files are monitored for changes, and the browser will
automatically reload the application and documentation pages.


## Production Build

To create a standalone, minified build of the application, run

```
$ gulp compile:app:prod
```

The output is created in the `dist` directory, and is suitable for
serving by any web server.


## Unit Tests

While gulp is serving the application, any changes to source or test
files will trigger the unit tests.  The tests can also be started at
any time by running

```
$ gulp test
```

### Code Coverage

The unit tests generate code coverage information using
[istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul), which is written
to the `coverage` directory. Open `./coverage/index.html` in a browser
to view coverage details for each source file.


## End to End Tests

To start end-to-end tests, run

```
$ gulp protractor
```

This uses
[selenium-standalone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-standalone),
so progress can be observed in the browser windows that pop up.

By default, tests are run in Chrome and Firefox, and Safari if the
testing is done on a Mac OS X host.  (NB, Firefox is currently
disabled until the driver issues between Selenium and newer versions
of Firefox are ironed out.)  To run the tests in a particular browser, use

```
$ gulp protractor:chrome
```

or

```
$ gulp protractor:firefox
```

or

```
$ gulp protractor:safari
```

The tests also by default run in four browser window sizes: xs
(600x800), sm (800x1024), md (1000x1024) and lg (1200x1024).  Add the
suffix `:xs`, `:sm`, `:md` or `:lg` to the `gulp` task to run in just
the one size.  For example

```
$ gulp protractor:chrome:xs
```
